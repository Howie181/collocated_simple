This was my submitted code for the final assignment of MIE1210H: Computational Fluid Mechanics and Heat Transfer at UofT. It is a SIMPLE algorithm developed for solving a lid driven cavity problem, the existing solver only has central-differenceing (no upwind) so it gets expensive fast. 

!!! IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY TAKING THAT COURSE DO NOT COPY AND PASTE AS YOUR SUBMISSION, READ THROUGH IT AND DEBUG YOUR CODE INSTEAD !!!  


One of the things that took me the longest to debug was the implementation of the relaxation factor, read exisitng literature carefully.
